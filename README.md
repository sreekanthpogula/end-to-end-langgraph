# end-to-end-langgraph
This repository contains an end-to-end example of using LangGraph to build a chatbot application. The code demonstrates how to create a state graph, define nodes and edges, and compile the graph for execution.
It includes a simple chatbot that interacts with users, processes their input, and generates responses based on predefined logic.
The main components of the code include:
- **StateGraph**: The core structure that defines the flow of the chatbot.
- **Nodes**: Represent different states or actions in the chatbot's workflow.
- **Edges**: Define the transitions between nodes based on user input or other conditions.
- **Message Handling**: The chatbot processes user messages and generates responses using a simple logic defined
in the `chatbot` function.
- **Execution Loop**: A loop that continuously prompts the user for input, processes it through
the graph, and outputs the chatbot's responses until the user decides to quit.


# langgraph.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the chatbot using LangGraph. It includes the necessary imports, the definition of the chatbot function, and the construction of the state graph. The notebook also includes
a loop that allows users to interact with the chatbot, providing input and receiving responses until they choose to exit.


# Recent Edits
These are the most recent edits made to the files in this repository. The edits include adding imports, defining the chatbot function, constructing the state graph, and implementing the interaction loop for the chatbot.
The edits are focused on building a functional chatbot using LangGraph, allowing users to engage in a conversation with the bot and receive contextually relevant responses.
